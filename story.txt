A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster);
a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.

The prognosis was grim for those unfortunate enough to be stricken with the dreaded plague of Avernus, the ghastly effects of which have
emptied the contents of many a stomach. Scrope had thought herself lucky to have lived a good portion of her life before fate had defiled
the land she once called home. Even in sickness, she has kept an admirable degree of composure. To live with the sickness for five years
was almost unheard of, yet it had not once gotten the better of her.

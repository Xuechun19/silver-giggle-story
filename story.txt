A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster);
a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.

The prognosis was grim for those unfortunate enough to be stricken with the dreaded plague of Avernus, the ghastly effects of which have
emptied the contents of many a stomach. Scrope had thought herself lucky to have lived a good portion of her life before fate had defiled
the land she once called home. Even in sickness, she has kept an admirable degree of composure. To live with the sickness for five years
was almost unheard of, yet it had not once gotten the better of her. 

One day, after receiving the doctor's final diagnosis, Miss. Purvis finally made up her mind that she have spent all her previous life on helping people and living up positively, "I deserve a happily regretless ending," she said to herself,"I shall try all the exciting things I've never done before in my last several months."

Thats it, she thought. I am going to go bungee jumping. Out of all the things she had done in life, she had not yet been able to bring herself to the top of the famous river dam that only those brave enough have bungee jumped. From all her hard work, she thinks its now time to cross this extreme sport from her bucket list!

So, she went bungee jumping, she met his lifelong desire, very happy to return home, relatives and friends came to the home to visit her, she is very happy, day after day passed, her state is very good...
